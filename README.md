**Hi there, I'm Phil Thomas, aka fz42.**

I'm a security consultant with a software engineering background. I'm currently working at [Stratum Security](https://stratumsecurity.com) doing a bit of everything, but mostly Application, Mobile, and Cloud Security.

Sometimes I write about security research, software development, and the intersection of both.
